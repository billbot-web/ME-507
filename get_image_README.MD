ESP32 Camera Interface — Getting Started

This guide will walk you through setting up the software for the ESP32-S3 + OV5640 camera project using the files in this repository. It assumes your hardware is already connected and powered correctly.

🧩 Repository Overview Working_Cam/ ├─ src/ │ └─ main.cpp # Firmware for ESP32 camera ├─ include/ ├─ platformio.ini # Build configuration (PlatformIO) ├─ plot_images.py # Python script to read/display frames over serial └─ README.md # This file

🚀 Step 1: Install Required Software

Install Visual Studio Code
Download and install VS Code .

Install PlatformIO
In VS Code:

Open the Extensions tab (Ctrl+Shift+X)

Search “PlatformIO IDE”

Click Install

Install Python (for plotting)
Install the latest Python 3.10+ from python.org/downloads .

During install: ✅ Check “Add Python to PATH.”

Then open a terminal and verify:

python --version pip --version

🧱 Step 2: Open the Project

Clone or download this repository. If you have Git installed:

git clone https://github.com//.git

Or, click “Code → Download ZIP” on GitHub and extract it.

Open the project folder (Working_Cam/) in VS Code.

PlatformIO should automatically detect the environment (look for the PlatformIO toolbar at the bottom).

⚙️ Step 3: Build and Upload Firmware

Connect your ESP32 board to your computer via USB. (Wait a few seconds for it to be recognized.)

In VS Code (bottom bar):

Click ✔ Build to compile the firmware.

Then click → Upload to flash it onto your board.

Wait for “Success” in the terminal. You should see a message like:

Writing at 0x00010000... (100 %) Hash of data verified. [SUCCESS] Took 21.5 seconds

Do not open the Serial Monitor yet — Python will handle it next.

🐍 Step 4: Install Python Dependencies

In your terminal (PowerShell, Command Prompt, or VS Code terminal):

cd Working_Cam pip install pyserial opencv-python

If OpenCV takes too long, you can also try:

pip install opencv-python-headless

🧠 Step 5: Find Your Serial Port

List available serial devices:

python -m serial.tools.list_ports

You’ll see something like:

COM4 - USB-SERIAL CH340 (ESP32-S3)

Use that port in the next step.

📸 Step 6: Run the Plotting Script

In the same folder:

python plot_images.py

If it says:

could not open port 'COM4': Access is denied.

➡ Close the VS Code Serial Monitor or any app using the same COM port. ➡ Or update the script to use your correct port (e.g., "COM7").

🖼 Step 7: View Output

If your firmware is transmitting image frames correctly, the Python script will:

Read binary JPEG data over serial.

Decode it using OpenCV.

Open a live window showing the captured frames.

Press Ctrl+C to stop streaming and close the window.

🧹 Step 8: (Optional) Common Fixes Problem Cause Fix PermissionError: COMx access denied Serial port in use Close PlatformIO Monitor Camera init failed (on ESP32 serial logs) Wrong wiring or config Check pin map in main.cpp cv2.error in Python Bad frame or mismatch Try smaller resolution or add small delay between frames No image Script baud rate mismatch Match Python BAUD with your firmware (e.g., 115200 or 921600) 🧪 Step 9: Verify Communication

You can check that frames are coming through by opening the Serial Monitor briefly:

In VS Code → PlatformIO → Monitor (115200 baud).

You should see log messages like:

Camera init OK Frame captured: 320x240

Close the Monitor before running Python again.

🧠 Extra Tips

You can safely modify plot_images.py to display grayscale, edge maps, or save frames.

To re-flash the ESP32 at any time, just click Upload again in VS Code.

If you unplug/replug the board, you may need to rerun the Python script with the new COM port.

📚 Summary

In short:

Install VS Code + PlatformIO

Install Python + dependencies

Open project → Build → Upload

Find your COM port

Run python plot_images.py to view frames

That’s it — your ESP32 camera stream should now display live images through your PC.
